  <h2>About QIIME 2 View</h2>
  <p>
    QIIME 2 View (or q2view for short) is an entirely client-side interface for viewing
    QIIME 2 artifacts and visualizations (.qza/.qzv files respectively). This means that
    you do not need to have a working QIIME 2 installation to inspect QIIME 2 results.
    It also means that the files you provide are not sent beyond your browser. In other
    words, this entire site functions without a server (which makes it very inexpensive
    to operate).
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, q2view supports viewing externally hosted files, which means you can
    provide a link to your file (for example on Dropbox) and q2view will automatically
    download and display it. Better yet, the resulting pages are themselves shareable,
    so if a collaborator does not have QIIME 2, you can simply upload your results and
    share your q2view links with your collaborator. q2view will automatically fetch your
    results and display them to your collaborator.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is all made possible through the new HTML5 <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >Service Worker API</a>.
    Because QIIME 2 results are actually zip files containing a <code>/data/
    </code> directory, q2view can hoist that content by giving its service worker a
    reference to the file. It can then serve individual HTML pages (as well as data,
    Javascript, and CSS) from that zipped directory as if they were a part of the website
    itself. This means our visualizations can become powerfully interactive and rich without
    compromising the portability of them.
  </p>
  <p>
    q2view also understands the <code>/provenance/</code> directory of every QIIME 2 result
    which means in addition to rehosting interactive rich content, it can display the
    specific actions, parameters, and even versions of the software used to generate the
    content. This means you never need to worry about losing track of what your
    visualizations represent.

  <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
  <p>This section is for common errors you may encounter when using q2view.</p>

    <div class="grid grid-cols-2">
      <div class="border border-red-300 rounded-md bg-red-100 p-4 mr-2">
        TypeError: Failed to fetch

    </div>
    <p class="pt-4">
      This can happen for a variety of reasons, but the most common are either the URL
      does not exist, you&apos;ve lost your internet connection, or the server does not
      support CORS and must set the <a href="#headers">required headers</a>.

      What you have provided is not a QIIME 2 .qza or .qzv file. It is possible that
      q2view is seeing an HTML page which may contain a .qza/.qzv file. If that is the
      case, try to find the link that is a <em>direct download</em> and provide that
      instead.

      The file you have provided is a .zip file, not a .qza or .qzv file (or there is
      something terribly wrong with your .qza/.qzv file). This interface only works
      on QIIME 2 files.

  <h2 id="headers">Required Headers</h2>
  <p>
    The following headers must be returned by the server in order for view.qiime2.org to
    be able to read the response. If they are not set, then the browser will deny access
    under the <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >Same-Origin Policy</a>.
  </p>
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr class="my-4">
        <th>Header Name</th>
        <th>Header Value</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr class="border-bottom my-4">
        <td>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</td>
        <td>view.qiime2.org</td>
        <td>(using * as the value is also acceptable)</td>

      <tr class="my-4">
        <td>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</td>
        <td>GET, HEAD</td>
        <td>(more methods may be provided, but these must at least be present)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>
    Additionally, the <strong>server must provide its content using HTTPS
    </strong> otherwise the Same-Origin Policy prevents access to the data.
