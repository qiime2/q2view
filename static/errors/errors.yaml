# Higher number means higher severity
#
# Severity 0: Error is cosmetic or extremely minor
#   ex. Some slider on a viz isn't working quite right
# Severity 1: Error can cause undesirable behavior but does not invalidate result
#   ex. Something wasn't being randomly sampled as intended, but it was still being
#       sampled in a valid way
# Severity 2: Error potentially renders result unusable
#   ex. A metric was calculated incorrectly
#
# Date is the date you are adding the error to this list not necessarily the
# date the error was discovered
